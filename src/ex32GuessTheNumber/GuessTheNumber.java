 * Guess the Number is a game with 3 levels of difficulty.
 * Level 1 - Guess a number between 1 and 10
 * Level 2 - Guess a number between 1 and 100
 * Level 3 - Guess a number between 1 and 1000
 * The program picks a random number in the range and prompts the player to guess, giving hints as to whether the
 * number is too low or too high. Once the player guesses correctly, the program presents the number of guesses
 * and asks the player if they want to play again.
