 * Take in a person's age and resting heart rate and use the Karvonen formula to return the target heart rate based
 * on intensities ranging from 55% to 95% (in 5% increments).
 * Note: I'm using integers, so all the numbers will be rounded down to nearest whole number.
 * Constraints: Don't hardcode the percentages, instead use a loop.
 * Ensure heart rate and age are numeric.
